        "summary": "A new report reveals that half of all Americans suffer from musculoskeletal (MSK) pain, a leading cause of disability and work absenteeism. The study highlights that MSK conditions, such as back pain, affect people across all age groups, and the growing prevalence of these disorders is linked to factors like sedentary lifestyles and aging. The report emphasizes the need for preventive measures and better access to treatment to manage MSK pain and improve quality of life for those affected.",

        "date": "June 14, 2022",
        "summary": "OSHA has launched a National Emphasis Program (NEP) to intensify efforts in preventing heat-related illnesses in the workplace, expanding on its heat illness prevention campaign. Effective from April 8, 2022, the NEP targets all industries, focusing particularly on sectors exposed to heat hazards, such as construction, agriculture, and manufacturing. It applies when outdoor temperatures exceed 80Â°F with 40% humidity or more. OSHA aims to increase inspections and heat-related citations, targeting high-risk workplaces during heat advisories or warnings.  The NEP includes both programmed and unprogrammed inspections, focusing on workplaces with recorded heat hazards or employee complaints. During inspections, OSHA will evaluate compliance with guidelines for hydration, shade, rest breaks, training, and employee acclimatization. Employers are urged to implement measures such as providing cool drinking water, heat illness programs, and rotating work schedules to minimize heat exposure. The initiative is set to remain in effect for three years unless modified or replaced.",
